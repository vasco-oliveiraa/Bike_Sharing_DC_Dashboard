        st.write("This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the bike-sharing service present in Washington D.C from 2011 to 2012. Our objective is to build an interactive and insightful report that will help the transportation department optimize their bike provisioning and costs incurred from outsourcing transportation companies. To achieve this, we will be building a predictive model that can predict the total number of bicycle users on an hourly basis.")

We have used the mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score to evaluate the model's performance. Based on our analysis, we have found that the Random Forest Regression model has the best performance with an MSE of 0.049 and an R2 score of 0.98.")

        st.write("Our analysis has provided insights into the usage of the bike-sharing service in Washington D.C. and how it can be optimized to reduce costs and improve service. The predictive model we have built can help the transportation department anticipate bike provisioning better and optimize the costs incurred from the outsourcing transportation company. We hope that our report will assist the transportation department in making data-driven decisions to improve the bike-sharing service in the city.")
